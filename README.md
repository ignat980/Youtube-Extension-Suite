# Youtube Extension Suite v0.2.1

This is an extension for [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com). It is meant to be like the Reddit Extension Suite, like with cool options and stuff :D

Since [Magic Actions](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/magic-actions-for-youtube/abjcfabbhafbcdfjoecdgepllmpfceif) may stop working, I wanted to start this project.

###Current features:
* Displays the length of time it would take to watch any playlist

###Working on:
* Caching playlist requests

###Planned:
* Playlist collections (basically better organization of playlists, instead of one huge list)
* Auto functions (Quality, Speed, Annotations, Liking, etc.)
* Volume change with scroll
* Enlarge photo on mouseover
* Hotkeys Customization (Play/Pause, Skip, Volume, Speed, etc.)
* Easier Playlist Creation
* Watch Playlist in reverse order
* Duplicate a playlist
* Infinite playlists

###Installation:
*\*This is for Google Chrome\**
1. Download the current release .crx file
2. Navigate to chrome://extensions
3. Drag and drop Youtube.Extension.Suite.crx into the page
